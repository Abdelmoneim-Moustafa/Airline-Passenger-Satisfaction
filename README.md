# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to identify key factors influencing satisfaction and build a predictive model.

## 🚀 Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into passenger satisfaction trends.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaning and transforming data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Training models to predict satisfaction.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Streamlit app for visualizing insights.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes passenger demographics, travel details, and satisfaction ratings.

📁 **File:** `airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv`

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of satisfaction levels
- Correlation heatmap
- Key factor analysis (Flight delay, Service quality, etc.)

## 🏗️ Model Training & Evaluation
- **Models Used:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🎛️ Dashboard
An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time data exploration.

## 🛠️ Installation
